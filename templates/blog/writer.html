    <strong>Hi, I'm Sepanta</strong> — a backend developer in training with a strong focus on Python and Django.
  </p>
  <p>
    This personal blog platform is the project I'm most proud of so far. I built it from scratch using Django, complete with user authentication, rich text editing (TinyMCE), image uploads, moderated comments, search functionality, categories and tags, and SEO-friendly sitemaps.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code is clean, well-documented, and follows Django best practices. Feel free to explore the source on GitHub!
